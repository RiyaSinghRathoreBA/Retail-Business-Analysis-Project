# Retail-Business-Analysis-Project
## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction, optimize product placement, and drive sales growth. Challenges include identifying frequently purchased item combinations, segmenting customers based on purchasing behaviors, and deriving actionable insights from large transactional datasets.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from an online retail store to address these challenges. It consists of three main components:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Uncovered trends in sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

Identified high-performing products and peak sales periods.

### Market Basket Analysis (MBA):

Used the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent item combinations.

Derived association rules to understand product co-purchasing patterns (e.g., customers who purchase "Tea" are likely to buy "Biscuits").

### Customer Segmentation:

Applied clustering techniques to group customers based on purchasing patterns.

Segments included high-value customers, occasional buyers, and bulk purchasers, helping design tailored marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

The project successfully provided actionable insights:

### From EDA: Key trends such as seasonal demand and top-performing products can guide inventory planning and promotional activities.

### From MBA: Frequent item combinations like "Tea" and "Biscuits" enable strategic product placement and bundled promotions.

### From Customer Segmentation: Understanding customer groups helps in personalizing marketing efforts and enhancing customer retention.

These analyses demonstrate the value of leveraging data to drive business decisions, improve customer experience, and boost profitability.
